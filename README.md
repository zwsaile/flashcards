## Abstract
This is a flashcard style quiz game that is fully operational through the
command line interface (CLI). The game will walk you through a series of multiple choice questions, or flashcards. You will be able to answer them one at a time, and the game will tell you if you have answered correctly or not. Upon completion of the of all flashcards, the command line will display a message detailing what percentage of flashcards were answered correctly.
